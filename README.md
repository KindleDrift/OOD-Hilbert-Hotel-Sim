## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of data structures and algorithms in simulating the concept of Hilbert's Hotel.

# 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KindleDrift/OOD-Hilbert-Hotel-Sim.git
cd OOD-Hilbert-Hotel-Sim
```

2. **Run the program:**
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- **time**: Libaries for tracking time spent on each function.
- **tracemalloc**: Libaries for tracking memories spent on each function.

*Note that all of this libaries mentioned are a part of Python built-in module. So no virtual environment are nessesary.*
